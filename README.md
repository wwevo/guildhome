# guildhome
This is a work in progress,
it is in a working state with basic features implemented, without much weight on security at the moment.
**Don't use this in a production enviroment**. 

This is intended to be a learning project for myself and others, so expect code-style changes and different levels of sophistication.

## Homepage for our beloved Guild Wars 2 guild: Evolution of Loneliness

For now the focus will be on events and event management as well as basic
community functions as well as optimizations of the code-base.

This Homepage, or Guildhome if you like, can help you bring your guild closer together. Post messages, plan events and subscribe to them, use an api-key and get some views and statistics on your guild. This project is becoming more modular with every update, it should be fairly easy to extend and modify.

If you think that you are able to contribute in any meaningful way, please don't hesitate to contact or just create Pull Requests for me to review. Very much appreciated would be work in the Area of Web-Design, Form-Design and making the Templates more uniform and organized. There is also a range of Issues marked with the 'help wanted' tag.

## How to get started
### Requirements
- MySQL Database, Webserver with PHP - easiest way to get that it downloading XAMPP

We are currently working on a database-setup module to get you started more easily, for now you have to set up the database by hand and also kinda extract the database-structure from the code ^^ Contact me for a working dump. I won't put one up here because it simply changes too often at the moment.
